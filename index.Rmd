# Preface {-}

I am starting writing this book to introduces and document some of the tools and methods I use to analyze and visualize data as a community ecologist working at multiple scale. This involve working with complex data sets and performing manipulation and computation that integrate aspect of statistic and geocomputation (GIS). My motivation here is to provide a framework that is based on **Open Source** project and multiplatform to enable democratic use of the methods and hopefully increase reproducibility of science. The other motivation is to self document and keep a trace of my progress as I often have to trace back what I have done in the past, often not so far away.

# Prerequisites

This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

For now, you have to install the development versions of **bookdown** from Github:

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```

Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading `#`.

To compile this example to PDF, you need to install XeLaTeX.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
