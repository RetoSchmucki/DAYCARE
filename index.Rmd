# Preface {-}

My intention with this book is not to provide another book about R programming or give a comprehensive presentation of GIS, database or statistical modelling in ecology, but rather to present toolbox of softwares and methods that I find immensely useful in my day to day work as an ecologist handling complex data sets. I must warn the readers that I am not a programmer nor a specialist in computer science, I would rater describe myself as an ecologists with strong interest in data science. Beside my motivation in presenting a set of tools and methods that can be useful to other ecologists, I am also a big fan of open source solutions.

My interest in open source solutions is twofold, first it enables development through joint effort and second it promotes equitable access to state-of-the art methods. I am conscious, however, that it  might also comes with a steeper learning curve which can be intimidating for some. On the other hand, I would argue that the comprehensive documentation and dynamic communities supporting the solutions presented here makes the sailing through much smoother than it might appear. On top of being open source/access, the solutions presented here are available for most operating systems Mac, Windows and Linux, and codes should be portable across these different platforms.

I am writing this book as a work-in-progress where I document some of the things that I know well and explore some others that are newer to me, but look particularly promising. This mean that while most tools and softwares presented here are mature projects, they are also actively developing , implementing new solutions with enhance possibilities. As the amount of data available for treatment is exponentially increasing, new frameworks with better integrated solutions are needed to generate efficient and reproducible procedures to manage and analyze them. Portable, well documented and reproducible workflows are particularly desirable to address the specific of challenges of working with complex and large data sets in collaborative research. Hopefully, this book will contribute to others and help myself document and keep a track of my  own progress as data analyst.
