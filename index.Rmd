# Preface {-}

I am starting writing this book to introduces and document some of the tools and methods I use to analyze and visualize data as a community ecologist working at multiple scale. This involve working with complex data sets and performing manipulation and computation that integrate aspect of statistic and geocomputation (GIS). My motivation here is to provide a framework that is based on **Open Source** project and multiplatform to enable democratic use of the methods and hopefully increase reproducibility of science. The other motivation is to self document and keep a trace of my progress as I often have to trace back what I have done in the past, often not so far away. 


an R package, **bookdown**, to change your workflow of writing books. It should be technically easy to write a book, visually pleasant to view the book, fun to interact with the book, convenient to navigate through the book, straightforward for readers to contribute or leave feedback to the book author(s), and more importantly, authors should not always be distracted by typesetting details.

The **bookdown** package is built on top of R Markdown (http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com), and inherits the simplicity of the Markdown syntax (you can learn the basics in five minutes; see Section \@ref(markdown-syntax)), as well as the possibility of multiple types of output formats (PDF/HTML/Word/...). It has also added features like multi-page HTML output, numbering and cross-referencing figures/tables/sections/equations, inserting parts/appendices, and imported the GitBook\index{GitBook} style (https://www.gitbook.com) to create elegant and appealing HTML book pages. This book itself is an example of how you can produce a book from a series of R Markdown documents, and both the printed version and the online version can look professional. You can find more examples at https://bookdown.org.

Despite the package name containing the word "book", **bookdown** is not only for books. The "book" can be anything that consists of multiple R Markdown documents meant to be read in a linear sequence, such as course handouts, study notes, a software manual, a thesis, or even a diary. In fact, many **bookdown** features apply to single R Markdown documents as well (see Section \@ref(a-single-document)).

# Prerequisites

This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

For now, you have to install the development versions of **bookdown** from Github:

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```

Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading `#`.

To compile this example to PDF, you need to install XeLaTeX.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
